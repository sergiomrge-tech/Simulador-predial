## Installation

### From a marketplace

```bash
# If this plugin is listed in a marketplace you've added:
/plugin install unity
```

### Direct (local testing)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Nice-Wolf-Studio/unity-claude-skills.git

# Run Claude Code with the plugin loaded
claude --plugin-dir ./unity-claude-skills
```

### Verify installation

```
/help              # Should show all unity:* skills
/context           # Check skills are within context budget
```

### Correctness Skills (Tier 1)

These skills use a **PATTERN format** (WHEN/WRONG/RIGHT/GOTCHA) to catch Claude's most common mistakes -- wrong code that compiles and looks correct.

| Skill | Scope | Files | Lines |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| `unity-3d-math` | Coordinate spaces, quaternions, Plane/Bounds, Camera projection, float precision | 2 | ~700 |
| `unity-physics-queries` | Query type selection, NonAlloc, hit ordering, layer masks, trigger interaction | 2 | ~600 |
| `unity-lifecycle` | Fake-null, Destroy deferral, editor vs runtime init, execution order, async destruction | 2 | ~600 |
| `unity-input-correctness` | Action reading, rebinding persistence, multiplayer devices, control schemes | 2 | ~550 |
| `unity-async-patterns` | Awaitable double-await, cancellation tokens, coroutine errors, Addressables | 2 | ~600 |

### Architecture Skills (Tier 2)

These skills use a **DECISION format** (WHEN/DECISION→Options/SCAFFOLD/GOTCHA) for architecture choices with genuine tradeoffs -- not one right answer, but the right answer for your context.

| Skill | Scope | Files | Lines |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| `unity-game-architecture` | Service Locator vs DI, MonoBehaviour vs plain C#, event architecture, bootstrap | 2 | ~800 |
| `unity-state-machines` | FSM, HFSM, Behavior Trees, stack machines, enum vs IState, testing | 2 | ~850 |
| `unity-data-driven` | SO vs JSON config, data pipelines, designer handoff, versioning/migration | 2 | ~750 |
| `unity-save-system` | Serialization formats, save architecture, PlayerPrefs, versioning, auto-save | 2 | ~850 |
| `unity-scene-assets` | Additive scenes, Addressables, AssetReference, loading screens, asset lifecycle | 2 | ~750 |

### Domain Translation Skills (Tier 3)

These skills use a **DESIGN INTENT format** (DESIGN INTENT/WRONG/RIGHT/SCAFFOLD/DESIGN HOOK) bridging designer vision to code architecture -- translating what the game SHOULD feel like into how it SHOULD be built.

| Skill | Scope | Files | Lines |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| `unity-game-loop` | Core loop scaffolding, session lifecycle, win/lose conditions, meta loops, difficulty, pacing | 2 | ~2,190 |
| `unity-npc-behavior` | Perception systems, decision layers, action pipelines, factions, NPC memory, squad coordination | 2 | ~2,970 |
| `unity-ui-patterns` | Screen flows, View/ViewModel, HUD architecture, feedback/juice, dynamic lists, transitions | 2 | ~1,880 |
| `unity-level-design` | Triggers, encounters, checkpoints, cinematics, interactables, level streaming | 2 | ~2,150 |
| `unity-procedural-gen` | Noise generation, tile/grid systems, dungeon generation, seeds, content budgets, baked vs runtime | 2 | ~1,955 |
